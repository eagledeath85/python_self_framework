- utils package:
    - fixture_scope.py:
                   - contains a FixtureScope class that has a usefixtures decorator that calls the setup fixture defined in the conftest.py.
                   This way test classes defined in the test package that inherit from FixtureScope will use the setup fixture as well
                   - contains logger method that allows to write logs in a file
                   - contains generic methods that can be reused for tests (verify_link_presence, select_options_by)

- pages_object package:
    - checkout_page.py:
                   - contains a CheckoutPage class with all the necessary attributes and methods to perform actions on the checkout page
    - confirm_page.py:
                   - contains a ConfirmPage class with all the necessary attributes and methods to perform actions on the confirmation page
    - home_page.py:
                   - contains a HomePage class with all the necessary attributes and methods to perform actions on the home page

- test package:
    - conftest.py:
                   - contains the setup fixture that will be used for the tests. For example, create the driver according to the user choice
                   - contains also a function that allows the user to run pytest with argument (here the browser can be defined as argument)

    - test_end2end.py:
                   - contains a class TestOne that inherits from the FixtureScope class. A method test_e2e describes the flow to test
    - test_home_page:
                   - contains a class TestHomePage that inherits from the FixtureScope class.
                   A method test_form_submission describes the flow to test.
                   A method login_credentials using fixture with params allows to run the test with multiple parameters (here different sets of credentials)
